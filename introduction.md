I was honoured to be asked to chair the Public Library Strategy  Advisory Group and to facilitate the conversations that helped  shape the vision set out in **Forward: Scotland’s Public Library  Strategy 2021-2025**.

The development of the strategy involved virtual meetings and  library visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than hinder  the process it opened the dialogue to a wide audience and  highlighted the strength of the global library network and the  generous and co-operative nature of the profession.

The Advisory Group brought together a range of people from  across the library sectors and stakeholder organisations to  examine the emerging trends and issues facing public libraries  as well as broader societal issues. The group met over three  informative and inspiring sessions, each of which focused  in turn on the overarching themes of People, Place and  Partnership. A programme of virtual visits provided practical  examples of innovation and best practice.

The Advisory Group meetings highlighted common goals for  members and provided opportunity for collaboration as part of  a broader societal mission to help communities reset and thrive.  Library staff across Scotland demonstrated their commitment  to stay connected to their communities during lockdown, to  really think outside the box and to design new models of delivery.

**Forward: Scotland’s Public Library Strategy 2021-2025** is a  bold new vision for libraries in Scotland. It builds on strong  foundations and demonstrates that public libraries are the  cornerstone of communities. The impact which public libraries  will make as a result of this strategy will support community  cohesion over the coming years, build capacity and promote  wellbeing.

I would like to thank the Advisory Group members, the Scottish  Government, COSLA and SLIC for their time, commitment, and  invaluable input to the development and production of this  strategy.
